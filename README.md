Implemented object detection using YOLO algorithm. YOLO involves a CNN network and images are processed as arrays of data and common traits are identified. 

Dataset used: 
Multiple training images of cars were extracted from AWS commandline and used. We detected licence plates of these vehicles. The training data consists of 1500 images and validation set consists of 300 images.

Technologies used:
We ran the model using Google Colab and used Python programming language. 

Methodology: 
We ran 3 models and compared the performance of all the three models.
